# File Picker Tweaks

This is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module that adds
support for various File Picker tweaks.

## Features

### Folder Restriction
This allows the GMs to restrict what folder(s) users can upload to on
the server. Thus helping GMs keep their servers cleaner.

GMs can also specify a user role which bypasses this, allowing the user
to upload to anywhere on the server (GMs always bypass this
restriction).
